# Data-Science Process/Storytelling  

In this project, we are exploring two COVID-19 datasets and one Influenza/ Pneumonia dataset to examine whether there would be correlations between diagnosis and death cases from COVID-19 and Influenza in the US. 
We have also looked into the dataset of community mobility during COVID-19 to investigate possible correlations between various community mobility features and confirmed cases of and/or deaths from Covid-19 in the US.
